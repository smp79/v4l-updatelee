This will set you up with Linux 5.10.44

# If you desire to compile your own kernel
# install any dependancies that you might need

	sudo apt-get install git build-essential ncurses-dev \
	libproc-processtable-perl fakeroot libelf-dev libssl-dev \
	bison flex pigz pkg-config bc

# Option 1: clone the full repository (@1.9Gb)

	git clone https://gitlab.com/updatelee/v4l-updatelee.git
	cd v4l-updatelee

# Option 2: Or if you don't need the entire repo history
# to conserve bandwidth downloading, please use

	git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/updatelee/v4l-updatelee.git
	cd v4l-updatelee

# Then compile, -j[number of cores in your processor], this will take around
# 20 min on my computer, so depending on your system it may take even longer.

	make x86_64-udl_defconfig
	make menuconfig		# Select any additional media drivers you want compiled
	make -j8 deb-pkg	# Adjust -j to number of cpu cores you may have

# Install the kernel

	sudo dpkg -i ../linux-*deb

# Install the firmware and reboot into new kernel

    cd drivers/base/firmware_loader/builtin	
	sudo make install
	sudo reboot

# Good to go, in the future if you need to upgrade 
# pull the latest changes, build new deb packages,
# install them and reboot

	cd v4l-updatelee
	rm ../linux-*
	make distclean
	git pull
	make x86_64-udl_defconfig
	make menuconfig		# Select any additional media drivers you want compiled
	make -j8 deb-pkg	# Adjust -j to number of cpu cores you may have
	sudo dpkg -i ../linux-*deb
	sudo reboot

# If you have crazy slow boot times it might be related to urandom

	sudo apt-get install haveged
	sudo systemctl enable haveged 
	sudo systemctl start haveged
