# Updatelee's repository based off of V4L media_tree and powARman's saa716x work.
#
# 

# This will set you up with Linux 3.19.0-rc1

# Download any dependancies that you might need

	sudo apt-get install git build-essential linux-headers-generic \
	ncurses-dev libproc-processtable-perl fakeroot

# Then download the repository, aprox 1.9Gb

	git clone https://bitbucket.org/updatelee/v4l-updatelee
	cd v4l-updatelee

# To compile and install first select any additional media drivers you want compiled.

	sudo make menuconfig

# Then compile, -j[number of cores in your processor], this will take around 20min on my 
# computer, so depending on your system it may take even longer.

	sudo make -j9 deb-pkg

# Install the kernel

	sudo dpkg -i ../linux-*deb

# reboot

	sudo reboot

# Good to go, in the future if you need to just recompile the modules then

	cd v4l-updatelee
	make modules
	
# and install modules

	sudo make modules_install

# unload/reload your modules or reboot

	sudo reboot

# To update just the include headers

	sudo make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/usr
